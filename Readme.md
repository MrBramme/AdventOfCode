Status: 2020 Day 1: Done!

# Advent Of Code

See [the advent of code site](https://adventofcode.com). This repo contains some solutions of mine. They might not all be pretty though :).

If you're participating in the event, I highly recommend you don't look at this repo!

Happy coding!

Note: while prepping for 2020 I opted to rework the solution and remove the old solutions. I might get around to adding them later.
